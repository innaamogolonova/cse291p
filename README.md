# LLM integrated Static Analyzer for C++ Memory Management Bug Fixes

A sophisticated tool that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) in conjunction with static analysis to identify and address memory safety vulnerabilities in C++ programs from the ARVO dataset.

## Overview

This project combines the power of modern AI with traditional static analysis techniques to detect and help resolve memory safety issues in C++ codebases. By utilizing the ARVO dataset as a benchmark, the tool provides targeted analysis of real-world applicable memory safety bugs.

## Dataset

This tool is designed to work with the ARVO dataset, a collection of C++ programs containing known memory safety vulnerabilities.
